# Genetic Algorithm Optimization

This is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm to optimize a fitness function. Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution, which use principles of inheritance, selection, mutation, and crossover to iteratively improve a population of candidate solutions.

## Prerequisites

This code requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- `random`
- `tqdm`

You can install these libraries using pip:

`pip install random tqdm`


## Usage

To use this code, simply run the `genetic_algorithm.py` script. The genetic algorithm parameters (population size, number of generations, and mutation rate) can be modified by changing the values of the corresponding variables at the top of the script. The fitness function can also be modified by changing the code in the `fitness` function.
