The code implements a simple genetic algorithm that tries to optimize a fitness function fitness(x) = x**2 by evolving a population of real-valued individuals. The algorithm starts by generating an initial population of random values in the range [-10, 10], and then proceeds to evolve the population over a fixed number of generations, using selection, crossover, and mutation operations to generate new individuals.

The original code had a number of limitations and shortcomings, including a small population size, a fixed mutation rate, a lack of elitism, and a single-point crossover operator. To address these limitations, the code was modified in several ways:

* The population size was increased to 50, to allow for more diversity and better exploration of the search space.

* The mutation rate was made adaptive, based on the standard deviation of the fitness values in the population. This allows the algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation more effectively, by reducing the mutation rate when the population is diverse and increasing it when it is homogeneous.

* Elitism was added, which allows the best individuals from the previous generation to be directly copied to the next generation, without undergoing genetic operations. This helps to preserve good solutions and avoid premature convergence.

* The selection operator was changed to tournament selection, which can be more effective than roulette wheel selection for some types of problems.

* The crossover operator was changed to uniform crossover, which can generate more diverse offspring and can be more effective for some types of problems.

* The mutation operator was extended to include Gaussian mutation, in addition to random reset mutation. Gaussian mutation can introduce small random changes to the offspring and help to escape from local optima.

* The code was made more modular and configurable, by using parameters to control the initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation strategies, as well as other aspects of the algorithm.

These changes make the genetic algorithm more robust, flexible, and effective, and should allow it to handle a wider range of optimization problems.
